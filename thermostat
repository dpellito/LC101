#You have a thermostat that allows you to set the room to any temperature between 40 and 90 degrees.

#The thermostat can be adjusted by turning a circular dial. If you turn the dial all the way to the left, 
#you will set the temperature to 40 degrees. If you turn to the right by one click, you will get 41 degrees. 
#As you continue to turn to the right, the temperature goes up, and the temperature gets closer and closer 
#to 90 degrees. But as soon as you complete one full rotation (50 clicks), the temperature cycles back 
#around to 40 and starts over.

#Write a program that calculates the temperature based on how much the dial has been turned. You should 
#prompt he user for a number of clicks-to-the-right. Then you should print the current temperature.


clicks_str = input("By how many clicks has the dial been turned?\n")
clicks = int(clicks_str)

total = int(clicks + 40)

if total <= 89:
    print("The temperature is " total)
else: 
    print("The temperature is " total % 50 + 40)
