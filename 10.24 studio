# Holiday - It is possible to name the days 0 through 6, where day 0 is Sunday and day 6 is Saturday. If you go on a wonderful 
# holiday leaving on day number 3 (a Wednesday) and you return home after 10 nights, you arrive home on day number 6 (a Saturday).

#Write a general version of the program which asks for the starting day number, and the length of your stay, and it will tell you
#the number of day of the week you will return on.

leaveday = float(input("What day are you leaving on?"))

staylength = float(input("How many days will you be gone?"))

totaldays = (leaveday + staylength)

answer = totaldays % 7

print(answer)


#learned about making float part of the input line, originally was finding input and converting types on next line.


if answer = 0.0
    print("Sunday")
elif answer = 1.0
    print("Monday")
elif answer = 2.0
    print("Tuesday")
elif answer = 3.0
    print("Wednesday")
elif answer = 4.0
    print("Thursday")
elif answer = 5.0
    print("Friday")
elif answer = 6.0
    print("Saturday")
