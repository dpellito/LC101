# Holiday - It is possible to name the days 0 through 6, where day 0 is Sunday and day 6 is Saturday. If you go on a wonderful 
# holiday leaving on day number 3 (a Wednesday) and you return home after 10 nights, you arrive home on day number 6 (a Saturday).

#Write a general version of the program which asks for the starting day number, and the length of your stay, and it will tell you
#the number of day of the week you will return on.
